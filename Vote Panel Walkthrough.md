### TO DO LIST:

## Next to each breakdown, type Date of completion.

## Vote Panel
 - http://arrav.net/vote/ - should look like this
 - People vote on sites for auth codes.
 - They will see the list of their auth codes as per the vote page on that url above.
 - They redeem auth codes on forums to turn them into vote points.
 - Vote points are stored on forums.
 - There is a vote shop on forums where people can spend their points on.
 - They simply enter the ingame username of the account they want to redeem the item on.
 - Make runelocus and rsps-list.com give 2 auth codes per vote?

Thanks,
